It is a mandatory directive by Pune Municipal Corporation, a notice will be issued to pet parents if they refuse to adhere to the order.
Residential association bodies and local authorities can solicit registration proof for the safety of the residents.
A pet registration document could be to your advantage in case of incidences or circumstances related to pets that require local body involvement.
Pet registration will help minimise the illegal animal breeding industry.
A Pet licence will serve as a record of the pet's detail and vaccination proof.
Documents required for pet registration.
Residential proof with NOC document.
Passport-size photo — front view, left view, and right view.
Ensure your pet is vaccinated before registration.

If you possess more than 1 pet, each pet has to be registered individually.
All documents are to be at a maximum size of 2 MB.
