       <b> Here is why I feel it’s important to register your pet. </b><br></br>
    
     <p>It is a mandatory directive by Pune Municipal Corporation, 
a notice will be issued to pet parents if they refuse to adhere to the order.
Residential association bodies and local authorities can solicit registration proof for the safety of the residents.

A pet registration document could be to your advantage in case of incidences or circumstances related to pets that
 require local body involvement.

A Pet licence will serve as a record of the pet's detail and vaccination proof.</p>
